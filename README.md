Description:
A Solidity smart contract that acts as a simple broker for stock listings. It allows users to check the availability of stock symbols, emit events for a given range of listings, and maintains a predefined list of popular stocks. Designed for educational purposes and basic listing management on the Ethereum blockchain.

If you want, I can also write a shorter 1–2 line version suitable for GitHub’s “short description” field. Do you want me to do that?

SimpleStockBroker

A Solidity smart contract that acts as a simple broker for stock listings. It allows users to check the availability of stock symbols, emit events for a range of listings, and maintains a predefined list of popular stocks. This project is designed for educational purposes and basic listing management on the Ethereum blockchain.

Features

Check Stock Availability: Verify if a stock symbol is available in the predefined list.

Emit Range Events: Emit events for a specific range of stock listings.

Predefined Stock List: Includes 10 popular stock symbols: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, META, NFLX, NVDA, BABA, JPM.

Ownership: The contract records the owner (msg.sender) who deployed it.

Contract Overview
Structs
struct lsiting {
    string name;
    uint256 uid;
}


Currently defined but not used in logic — can be expanded for advanced listing management.

Mappings
mapping(uint256 => string) listings;


Stores stock listings by ID.

Functions
checkStatus(string memory _name)

Checks if a stock symbol is available in the predefined list.

function checkStatus(string memory _name) public view returns(string memory)


Returns "available" if the symbol exists.

Returns "not available" if it doesn’t exist.

range(uint _range)

Emits events for a given range of stock listings.

function range(uint _range) public


Emits RangeValue events for stock symbols from 0 to _range - 1.

Reverts with "out of bound" if _range exceeds list length.

Events
event RangeValue(string value);


Emitted when calling range() function to broadcast stock symbols.

Usage

Deploy Contract: Deploy SimpleStockBroker on an Ethereum testnet or local development environment.

Check Stock Availability: Call checkStatus("AAPL") → returns "available".

Emit Range of Stocks: Call range(5) → emits events for the first 5 stock symbols.

Future Improvements

Implement the lsiting struct fully with UID management.

Allow adding/removing stocks dynamically.

Integrate with ERC20 tokens for stock trading simulation.

Add modifiers to restrict certain functions to the contract owner.
